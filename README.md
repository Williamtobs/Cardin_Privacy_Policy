# Cardin_Privacy_Policy

Welcome to the Cardin Trade app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Akeem William Tobi for Cardin Africa. The app is also available on Google Play.

As an organization, we take privacy very seriously. we know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

We have programmed this app to collect personal information like email, phone, name, account details, etc. All these collected data are stored on our secure server. These data are collected so we can provide accurate services for you.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,

Team Cardin.
